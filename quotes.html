														 maximize the participation and help from their parents<BR>
														 not only on the material components but also the<BR>
														 development of a loving think tank who can share their<BR>

														 "I just finished reading the wedding book - it's perfect. I<BR>
														 enjoyed so many sections. It brought back many memories<BR>
														 of 4 weddings we had in 4 years. I especially liked 'Truth<BR>
														 & Consequences' - heavy duty issues for sure. 'Flexibility'<BR>
														 was another one I enjoyed - good stuff. Another favorite<BR>
														 was "Sit Happens!' You have a gift for writing. I know you<BR>
														 will help many people planning a wedding. So much good advice!!"<BR><BR>
