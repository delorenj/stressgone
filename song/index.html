			<font face="lucida bright" size="6">You were only seven weeks old<BR>
		When they called us on the phone<BR>
		You needed surgery we were told<br>
		Not fair to face it alone<br><br>
		They asked us to be your mom and dad<br>
		And we knew right from the start<br>
		That we would love you with all we had<BR>
		Keeping you deep inside our heart<Br><br>
		<I>We were put together<BR>
		Don't know who needed who<br>
		Did you really need us?<br>
		Or was it us who needed you?<br><br>
		Through the years we'd stumble<br>
		Mistakes there were a few<br>
		But in our family<br>
		Our love always got us through.<BR><BR></I>
		With Matt you've found contentment<br>
		That's all we wanted for you<br>
		Health, heappiness and love<br>
		Your whole life through<br><Br>
		<I>We were put together<BR>
		Don't know who needed who<br>
		Did you really need us?<br>
		Or was it us who needed you?<br><br>
		Yes God put us together<br>
		Just you, us and your brother<br>
		Who needed who?<br>
		The truth is...we needed each other<br></I><br>
